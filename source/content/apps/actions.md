feedbackNote: |
  ### If you get a “com.apple.extensionKit.errorDomain error 2” error when running your shortcut or if the actions don't show up in the Shortcuts app, restart your device. This is caused by an iOS bug.

  **Some actions that are not possible: orientation lock status, flashlight status, ambient sensor info, flight mode status. Generally, anything related to changing system features/settings or interacting with other apps is not possible.**

The app provides lots of powerful extra actions for the Shortcuts app on macOS, iOS, and visionOS. These actions make it significantly easier to create shortcuts.

**Restart your device if the actions do not show up in the Shortcuts app.**
